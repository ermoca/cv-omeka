Hello !

I am a french computer scientist with a 9 years experience in building impactful softwares.

I discovered Omeka while looking for opportunities to contribute to the future of museums and online exhibits, idealy with open-source solutions.

My greatest strength resides in my versatility : from UX design to customer support, from system administration to responsive UI, from ever-learning student to experimented teacher.

If you are interested in my profile, I would be delighted to join your team. Have a nice day.

Erica
