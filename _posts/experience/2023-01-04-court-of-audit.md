I was part of the 3d season of the <a href="https://eig.etalab.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">"Entrepreneur d'Intérêt Général"</a> program on the <a href="https://eig.etalab.gouv.fr/defis/plume/" target="_blank">Plume</a> project. I joined an open-source community to contribute to their growing software and adapt it to our specific needs. I eventually lead a team of four.
